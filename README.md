# Watertaps

Experiment to create a Chrome Extension. This extension reads the JWT from local storage on https://dashboard.hammerhead.io and uses it to add watertaps to an existing route. Only works for routes in the Netherlands because it uses data from [drinkwaterkaart.nl](https://drinkwaterkaart.nl).
